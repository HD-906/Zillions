    (description "Object: Be the first player to get 4 of your pieces in a row,
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  Moves are made by dropping pieces
          to the lowest unoccupied space in a column.")
    (history "Also known as Gravitational TicTacToe and 4-in-a-row, this game has been
        marketed in a 7x6 version under the name Connect-4.")
    (strategy "Try to position your checkers to get as many `potential` 4-in-a-rows
        as possible, and use these threats to prevent your opponent from dropping
        into as as many columns as you can.    The best opening move for Red on
        boards with odd numbers of columns is to drop into the central column.\\
        Victor Allis, a Dutch computer scientist, proved in the late 1980's that Red
        has a forced win on the 7x6 board.")
